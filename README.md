# Recurse Center

Attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) for the Winter 1 2024 batch (2024 Nov 4-2025 Feb 14).

Daily work/progress recorded on [Notion](https://michaelschung.notion.site/recurse-center).

## Rundown of subfolders

Tried out many different groups at the start of the program, but that steadily dwindled to a few focus areas. Thus, most of these subfolders don't go all that far.

- `creative-coding`: spent one day working on a light refraction simulator in p5.js
- `cs-fundamentals`: met weekly in a small group to review fundamental data structures and algorithms, and to re-learn C for fun
- `grading-platform-flask`: a quick foray into Flask as a potential framework for building a flexible grading platform
- `impossible-day-nov-19-oof`: tried to hack together a whole web app (frontend, backend, db) in a single day without really knowing what I was doing; basically just accomplished db reads and writes
- `interview`: files from the RC interview process
- `leetcode`: thought I'd do a LeetCode problem every day; did more than just the two here but only copied over the code for these ones
- `missing-semester`: notes and test code from the [Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course from MIT - complete!
- `nature-of-code`: spent a couple weeks in the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) reading group; here are some exercises/playgrounds
- `project-euler`: another daily coding challenge, problems sourced from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/); went further than LeetCode
- `random-fun`: a folder for assorted one-off stuff; includes a Game of Life implementation and a test of the [arxiv.org API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html)
